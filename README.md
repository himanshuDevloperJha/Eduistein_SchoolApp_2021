Android smart School app for teacher and student having features of online attendance , timetable, notice , Homework , Syllabus ,content sharing ,educational video sharing by youtube API etc.
We have developed a Smart school app using Kotlin and Firebase for backend. This app is a generic type app where many schools can use it by just taking our membership.The development process held on Github with proper comments so the new developer does not face problems to understand code. Moreover we also have a database model through which developer can understand databases and backends. 
 
--------------Working of App--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
for eg. Let ABC school get enrolled with our app then we will give them credentials to school admin ,using that admin can login to the app and they start to add teachers using magic link( Email sent to teacher via email, teacher can signup to school app ) and create classes and subjects in respective classes. Now, admin can add a teacher as class teacher of a class or add subject teacher for a subject.  
 
The same app has 3 UI for Admin ,Teacher and Student. In our app we have defined 2 types of teachers. The first one is a class teacher which will act as an admin for the allotted class​ and have authority to add students ,set timetables, do announcements , take attendance etc. The second is a ​subject teacher​ who have control for only the allotted class and can control few features for that subject like content sharing( Syllabus, pdf etc) , posting homework sheet,do announcements related to the subject , add mark of various tests, term exams, UTs and final exam etc.  
 
Same signup process works for students but in this case only the class teacher can add students. The student app gets updated with each and everything which the teacher adds, share ,post etc. Like they can see their attendance, time table , allotted teacher , can check marks, see new 
announcements and download content , homework sheet and few more features.  
 
Now we are in the second phase of development and want to add some advanced features.
